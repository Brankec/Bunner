# Bunner

A generic 2D platformer that I'm working on as a project.

Controls:
- A - Left
- D - right
- Space - Jump

Features:
- very basic and buggy AABB Collision(The player sometimes gets stuck a little when jumping on the edge but eventually gets pushed back)
- basic 2D platformer movements with a simple Lerp acceleration and deceleration
- supports 3 layers of drawing. Background, Main(aka player layer), Foreground. Background and Foreground are used for decorations


Upcoming features:
- player animation
- optimized drawing
- bullet/projectile class
